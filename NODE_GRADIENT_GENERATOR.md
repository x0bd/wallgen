# Project Proposal: Node-Based Gradient Generator

## 1. Introduction

The goal of this project is to create a web-based visual tool for generating complex and animated gradients using a node editor. Users will be able to connect different operational nodes (e.g., color inputs, mathematical operations, noise functions) to construct a shader graph, which will be translated into GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) and rendered in real-time using React Three Fiber (R3F).

This tool will empower designers and developers to create unique, dynamic gradients and visual effects without directly writing shader code, offering a more intuitive and interactive creation process.

## 2. Core Features

-   **Node-Based Editor:** Intuitive drag-and-drop interface for adding, connecting, and configuring nodes.
-   **Real-time GLSL Rendering:** Live preview of the generated gradient using React Three Fiber.
-   **GLSL Shader Generation:** Automatic translation of the node graph into a fragment shader.
-   **Variety of Nodes:** Including inputs (colors, numbers, UVs, time), operators (math, mix, step, noise), and outputs.
-   **Parameter Control:** Each node will have configurable parameters (e.g., color pickers, sliders).
-   **Animation Capabilities:** Support for time-based animations through dedicated time nodes or by animating parameters.
-   **Export Options (Future):**
    -   Export generated GLSL shader code.
    -   Export static image of the gradient.
    -   Export animation (e.g., GIF, video sequence - more advanced).
-   **Save/Load Functionality:** Allow users to save and load their node graph configurations.
-   **Starter Templates:** Pre-defined node setups for common gradient types.

## 4. High-Level Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation & Simple Linear Gradient

1.  **Project Setup:**
    -   Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
    -   Install R3F, `three.js`, React Flow, Zustand, and Shadcn/UI.
2.  **Basic R3F Scene:**
    -   Create a simple R3F canvas with a plane mesh that fills the viewport. This plane will display the shader output.
3.  **React Flow Setup:**
    -   Integrate React Flow canvas into a page/component.
    -   Define basic styling for the node editor.
4.  **Core Custom Nodes (Initial Set for Linear Gradient):**
    -   `InputColorNode`: Outputs a `vec3/vec4` color. UI: color picker.
    -   `InputUVNode`: Outputs `vec2` UV coordinates.
    -   `OperatorSwizzleNode`: (e.g., to extract `.x`, `.y`, `.z`, `.w` from vectors). For linear gradient, extract `uv.y`.
    -   `OperatorMixNode`: Takes two colors and a factor (`float`) to interpolate.
    -   `OutputDisplayNode`: Takes a `vec4` color and represents `gl_FragColor`.
5.  **Basic Shader Generation Logic (Linear Gradient):**
    -   Develop a system to traverse the connected nodes (initially hardcoded for the linear gradient structure).
    -   Generate a GLSL fragment shader string based on these nodes.
    -   Define how uniforms (e.g., from `InputColorNode`) are declared in the shader.
6.  **R3F Shader Integration:**
    -   Use R3F\'s `shaderMaterial` (or `THREE.ShaderMaterial`).
    -   Pass the generated fragment shader string to this material.
    -   Pass initial uniform values (e.g., default colors).
7.  **Live Preview & Uniform Updates:**
    -   Ensure the R3F plane updates when the shader string changes (node structure changes).
    -   Implement updates to shader uniforms when parameters in nodes (e.g., color picker in `InputColorNode`) are modified, triggering a re-render of the gradient.

### Phase 2: Expanding Node Functionality & Editor Features

1.  **Develop More Node Types:**
    -   `InputNumberNode` (float/scalar)
    -   `InputTimeNode` (for animation)
    -   `OperatorMathNode` (add, subtract, multiply, sin, cos, etc.)
    -   `OperatorStepNode`, `OperatorSmoothstepNode`
2.  **Refine Shader Generation:**
    -   Implement a more robust topological sort algorithm for executing nodes in the correct order.
    -   Improve unique variable naming for node inputs/outputs in GLSL.
    -   Handle different data types for node sockets (`float`, `vec2`, `vec3`, `vec4`).
3.  **UI for Node Management:**
    -   Create a sidebar or panel listing available nodes that can be dragged onto the editor.
    -   Implement a properties panel that appears when a node is selected, allowing its parameters to be edited.
4.  **Edge/Connection Validation:**
    -   Basic type checking for connections (e.g., prevent connecting a `vec3` output to a `float` input directly if not intended).
    -   Visual feedback for invalid connections.

### Phase 3: Advanced Nodes & Polish

1.  **Advanced Node Types:**
    -   `NoiseNode` (Perlin, Simplex, or basic pseudo-random - might require importing GLSL noise functions).
    -   `TextureNode` (input an image to be used as a texture `sampler2D` - more complex).
    -   `UVTransformNode` (for rotating, scaling, offsetting UVs).
2.  **State Management with Zustand:**
    -   Store the node graph (nodes, edges, parameters) in Zustand.
    -   Persist graph to local storage for auto-save or implement manual save/load.
3.  **Error Handling & Debugging:**
    -   Display GLSL compilation errors to the user if the generated shader is invalid.
    -   Visual indicators for nodes with errors.
4.  **Starter Templates:**
    -   Implement functionality to load pre-defined node graph configurations (e.g., radial gradient, animated noise).
5.  **Performance Optimizations:**
    -   Optimize shader generation if it becomes a bottleneck.
    -   Ensure smooth UI performance with many nodes.

### Phase 4: Export & Deployment (Future Considerations)

1.  **Export GLSL Code:** Allow users to copy or download the generated fragment shader.
2.  **Export Image:** Render the current gradient to a static image (PNG/JPG).
3.  **Deployment:** Prepare the application for deployment on a platform like Vercel.

## 5. Key Challenges

-   **Dynamic GLSL Generation:** Translating a dynamic graph of nodes into valid, efficient, and ordered GLSL code is the primary challenge. This includes managing variable names, dependencies, and ensuring correct data flow.
-   **React Flow & R3F Integration:** Ensuring smooth communication and state synchronization between the React Flow UI, the application state (Zustand), and the R3F WebGL canvas.
-   **Uniform Management:** Efficiently declaring and updating GLSL uniforms based on node parameters.
-   **User Experience:** Designing an intuitive and user-friendly node editor interface, especially for users not familiar with shader programming.
-   **Complexity of Advanced Nodes:** Nodes like noise or texture samplers add significant complexity to both the UI and the shader generation.

## 6. Conclusion

Building a node-based gradient generator is a challenging but highly rewarding project. It combines visual programming, real-time 3D graphics, and shader fundamentals into a creative tool. By following an iterative, phased approach, starting with a simple implementation and gradually adding features, we can manage complexity and build a powerful application.
