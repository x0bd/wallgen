## **Iterative & Recursive Implementation Plan: Generative Wallpaper App (Black & White Brutal)**

This plan outlines the development process for your generative wallpaper application in an iterative and recursive manner, focusing on the tasks to be completed in each phase. Each step builds upon the foundation laid by the previous ones, and similar processes are repeated (recursed) as new features are added. The styling will adhere to a strict black and white, brutal aesthetic.

### **Phase 1: Foundation \- Project Setup & Core Integration**

This phase establishes the basic structure and the connection between Next.js/React and P5.js.

* **Iteration 1.1: Project Initialization:**  
  * Task: Create a new Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS configured.  
  * Task: Navigate into the new project directory.  
  * Task: Remove unnecessary boilerplate files to start clean.  
* **Iteration 1.2: P5.js Dependency:**  
  * Task: Add P5.js and its TypeScript types as project dependencies.  
* **Iteration 1.3: Main Page Structure:**  
  * Task: Define the core layout of the main application page (src/app/page.tsx) using Tailwind classes.  
  * Task: Apply initial minimal styling focusing on structure, using only black and white for borders and backgrounds.  
* **Iteration 1.4: P5.js Canvas Component:**  
  * Task: Create a new React component (src/components/P5Canvas.tsx) to encapsulate the P5.js canvas.  
  * Task: Set up a mechanism within this component to reference a DOM element for the canvas.  
  * Task: Implement the logic to initialize a P5.js sketch instance when the component appears.  
  * Task: Implement the logic to clean up the P5.js instance when the component is removed.

### **Phase 2: First Iteration \- Basic Generative Art & Display**

This phase focuses on getting the first generative algorithm (Perlin Noise) working and displayed within the application, using only black and white.

* **Iteration 2.1: Basic Perlin Noise Sketch (Black & White):**  
  * Task: Define the P5.js sketch function within the P5Canvas component.  
  * Task: Implement the sketch's setup logic to create the canvas and set initial drawing modes, using grayscale or black/white color modes.

  * Task: Use hardcoded values for noise parameters within the sketch for this initial version.  
* **Iteration 2.2: Display Canvas:**  
  * Task: Import the P5Canvas component into the main page component.

* **Iteration 3.1: Core UI Components (Black & White):**  
  * Task: Create reusable React components for a slider, a dropdown, and a button. (A color picker is not needed in a black and white scheme).  
  * Task: Style these components using Tailwind to match the brutal black and white theme (bold text, strong black borders, solid black/white backgrounds).  
* **Iteration 3.2: Application State:**  
  * Task: In the main page component, set up state variables using React hooks to hold the values for generative parameters (e.g., noise scale, algorithm type).  
  * Task: Initialize these state variables with default values.  
* **Iteration 3.3: Connecting UI to State:**  
  * Task: Render the UI components created in Step 3.1 on the main page.  
  * Task: Pass the state variables down as props to the respective UI components.  
  * Task: Implement event handlers in the UI components to update the parent component's state when their values change.  
* **Iteration 3.4: Passing State to P5.js:**  
  * Task: Pass the state variables from the main page component down as props to the P5Canvas component.  
  * Task: Modify the P5.js sketch logic within P5Canvas to read and use these parameter props instead of hardcoded values.  
  * Task: Implement logic to update the P5.js sketch's internal variables or trigger redraws when relevant props change.

### **Phase 4: Deep Customization & Brutal Styling Refinement**

This phase focuses on making the art more customizable within the black and white constraint and refining the UI's brutal aesthetic.

* **Iteration 4.1: Black and White Mapping Customization:**  
  * Task: Add UI controls (e.g., sliders) to control how noise values are mapped to grayscale or thresholded black/white.  
  * Task: Update the application state to manage these mapping parameters.  
  * Task: Modify the P5.js sketch to use these parameters to control the black/white or grayscale output.  
* **Iteration 4.2: UI Styling Refinement (Brutal):**  
  * Task: Enhance the Tailwind styling of all UI components to fully embody the brutal black and white theme:  
    * Use sharp, prominent black borders (border-4, border-black).  
    * Employ solid black backgrounds with white text, or vice versa.  
    * Ensure minimal padding and margin, creating a dense, impactful feel.  
    * Use uppercase text for labels or buttons.  
    * Implement stark hover effects (e.g., inverting black/white).  
    * Consider using a monospace font for input fields or labels.  
* **Iteration 4.3: Perlin Noise Parameter Expansion:**  
  * Task: (Recursive) Add state variables for additional Perlin noise parameters (noiseDetail levels and falloff, animation speed).  
  * Task: (Recursive) Add Slider components for these new parameters.  
  * Task: (Recursive) Connect the new Sliders to update the state.  
  * Task: (Recursive) Pass the new state variables to the P5Canvas.  
  * Task: (Recursive) Modify the P5.js sketch to use the new parameters to control noise generation and animation within the black and white output.

* **Iteration 6.2: UI Responsiveness (Brutal):**  
  * Task: Use Tailwind's responsive utility classes to adjust the layout and styling of the UI controls for different screen breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop), ensuring the brutal black and white aesthetic is preserved.  
* **Iteration 6.3: Performance Optimization:**  
  * Task: Use browser developer tools to identify performance bottlenecks, especially in the P5.js drawing loop.
